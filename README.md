# Tabletop Exercise Plan For Payment Card Breach In A Retail Chain

<h2>Overview:</h2>
This tabletop exercise was done to simulate the detection and response to a payment card data breach within a retail chain, following the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) incident response requirements. As a Regulatory and Corporate Compliance Officer at a retail chain, I conducted this exercise to guide the incident response team (IRT) through the stages of identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned, while also focusing on communication protocols and the evaluation of the response plan.
